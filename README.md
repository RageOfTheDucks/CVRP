# CVRP
A set of $n$ goods have to be delivered by a fleet of $m$ couriers to different customer locations.

Each courier's vehicle has a maximum capacity.

Each item has a size and needs to be transported to the right location. 

A courier's item load cannot exceed its maximum capacity. 

All couriers begin and end their route at a single depot, situated at the origin $o$.

It is required to plan a tour for each courier, i.e. define the sequence of locations visited to deliver the items. The objective is to minimize the total tour distance.
